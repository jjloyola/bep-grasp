# Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) metaheuristic for the resolution of the Bus Evacuation Problem
### *Author: Javiera Loyola Vitali*

The [**Bus Evacuation Problem**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00291-011-0256-1) is a route planning problem, in the context of an evacuation in an emergency situation. Considering that public transport is available to support the evacuation, the objective of the problem is to determine the best route for each vehicle, to move all the people from a risk zone to open shelters located in safe zones, such that the evacuation time is minimized.

In this work we present a method based on the **Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)** metaheuristic to solve the problem. In computational experiments we demonstrate that our approach is effective to solve real-world size problems, and able to outperform a commercial MIP solver. 

This project was initially developed as a requirement to obtain the title of Bs. in Computer Science, and then adapted as a conference paper, that was presented in the [IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, 2017](https://www.esteco.com/corporate/ieee-congress-evolutionary-computation-cec-2017).

In this case, we focus on applying the study specially to a real-based scenario. [The Great Fire of Valparaı́so](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10694-014-0427-0) is a wildfire that took place in Chile in 2014. It started as a forest fire and then spread to an inhabited area, consuming a total of 1,000ha, and burning close to 2,900 homes according to local sources. It displaced approximately 12,500 people, from which around 2,500 were taken to shelters.
